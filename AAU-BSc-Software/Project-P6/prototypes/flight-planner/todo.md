Based on the images you've shared and your code, I can see the issue with your grid generation algorithm. The current implementation creates a uniform grid over the bounding box of your polygon, resulting in many unnecessary grids that barely intersect with your target area.

## Optimization Strategies

Here are several ways to optimize your grid generation:

### 1. Implement a More Intelligent Intersection Check

Your current code uses a simple `intersects()` check, which includes grids that have minimal overlap with your target polygon. Instead, you could:

```python
# Replace this:
if polygon.intersects(grid_polygon):
    # ...

# With this:
intersection = polygon.intersection(grid_polygon)
intersection_area = intersection.area
grid_area = grid_polygon.area

# Only include grids with significant overlap (e.g., at least 20%)
if intersection_area / grid_area > 0.2:
    # ...
```

### 2. Use Adaptive Grid Placement

Instead of placing grids uniformly, you could implement an adaptive approach:

```python
def calculate_adaptive_grid_placement(coordinates, altitude, overlap_percent, min_coverage=0.2):
    # Initial setup code remains the same...

    # Start with a coarse grid
    grid_data = []
    for i in range(num_y):
        for j in range(num_x):
            # Calculate grid as before
            center_x = minx + j * step_x + grid_width / 2
            center_y = miny + i * step_y + grid_height / 2

            # Calculate corners and create polygon
            local_corners = [
                (center_x - grid_width / 2, center_y - grid_height / 2),
                (center_x + grid_width / 2, center_y - grid_height / 2),
                (center_x + grid_width / 2, center_y + grid_height / 2),
                (center_x - grid_width / 2, center_y + grid_height / 2)
            ]
            grid_polygon = Polygon(local_corners)

            # Calculate intersection and coverage
            intersection = polygon.intersection(grid_polygon)
            intersection_area = intersection.area
            grid_area = grid_polygon.area
            coverage = intersection_area / grid_area

            # Only include grids with significant coverage
            if coverage > min_coverage:
                # Convert and add to grid_data as before
                # ...

    return grid_data
```

### 3. Implement a Greedy Coverage Algorithm

A more sophisticated approach would be to implement a greedy algorithm that places grids to maximize coverage:

1. Start with an empty set of grids
2. Repeatedly add the grid that covers the most uncovered area until the entire polygon is covered
3. This ensures minimal redundancy

### 4. Optimize Overlap Percentage Dynamically

Instead of using a fixed overlap percentage, you could adjust it based on the shape of your polygon:

```python
# Calculate a shape complexity metric
perimeter = polygon.length
area = polygon.area
complexity = perimeter**2 / (4 * math.pi * area)  # Circularity measure

# Adjust overlap based on complexity
adjusted_overlap = min(base_overlap + (complexity - 1) * 5, max_overlap)
```

### 5. Use Concave Hull Instead of Bounding Box

Your current approach uses the rectangular bounding box of the polygon, which can be inefficient for irregularly shaped areas. Consider using the concave hull of your points instead:

```python
from scipy.spatial import Delaunay
import numpy as np

def alpha_shape(points, alpha):
    """
    Compute the alpha shape (concave hull) of a set of points.
    """
    # Implementation details...

# Then use this concave hull to determine grid placement
```

## Modified Code Example

Here's a modified version of your `calculate_grid_placement` function that incorporates some of these optimizations:

```python
def calculate_optimized_grid_placement(coordinates, altitude, overlap_percent, min_coverage=0.2):
    """Calculate optimal grid placement with improved efficiency"""
    # Initial setup remains the same...

    # Calculate grid size based on altitude
    grid_width, grid_height = calculate_grid_size(altitude)

    # Calculate step size considering overlap
    step_x = grid_width * (1 - overlap_percent / 100)
    step_y = grid_height * (1 - overlap_percent / 100)

    # Calculate number of grids needed in each direction
    num_x = math.ceil((maxx - minx) / step_x)
    num_y = math.ceil((maxy - miny) / step_y)

    # Generate grid centers with improved filtering
    grid_data = []
    for i in range(num_y):
        for j in range(num_x):
            # Calculate center of current grid in local coordinates
            center_x = minx + j * step_x + grid_width / 2
            center_y = miny + i * step_y + grid_height / 2

            # Calculate corners of the grid in local coordinates
            local_corners = [
                (center_x - grid_width / 2, center_y - grid_height / 2),
                (center_x + grid_width / 2, center_y - grid_height / 2),
                (center_x + grid_width / 2, center_y + grid_height / 2),
                (center_x - grid_width / 2, center_y + grid_height / 2)
            ]

            # Create grid polygon in local coordinates
            grid_polygon = Polygon(local_corners)

            # Calculate intersection and coverage
            intersection = polygon.intersection(grid_polygon)
            intersection_area = intersection.area
            grid_area = grid_polygon.area
            coverage = intersection_area / grid_area

            # Only include grids with significant coverage
            if coverage > min_coverage:
                # Convert center and corners back to geographic coordinates
                geo_center = to_wgs84(center_x, center_y)
                geo_corners = [to_wgs84(x, y) for x, y in local_corners]

                # Store as (lat, lon) format
                grid_data.append({
                    "center": (geo_center[1], geo_center[0]),
                    "corners": [(corner[1], corner[0]) for corner in geo_corners],
                    "coverage": coverage
                })

    return grid_data
```

This optimized approach should significantly reduce the number of unnecessary grids while ensuring proper coverage of your target area.
