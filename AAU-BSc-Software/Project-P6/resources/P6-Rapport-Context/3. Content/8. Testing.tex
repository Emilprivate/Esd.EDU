\chapter{Testing}

The testing approach for this project covers four main types of tests: \textbf{unit tests}, \textbf{integration tests}, \textbf{system tests}, and \textbf{acceptance tests}. Unit tests check individual components in isolation, integration tests verify the interaction between modules, system tests assess the complete system in a simulated or real environment, and acceptance tests confirm that the final product meets the specified requirements.

All test cases follow the \textbf{AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)} pattern to ensure a consistent and structured testing process.
